These are the source files that go along with Part 1
of my Create A Machine Learning Library in C++ Series
located at http://joediv.com.

main.cpp requires that Armadillo C++ Library is installed  in
order to compile. The library can be found at their website:

http://arma.sourceforge.net/

The Mac Accelerate Framework, or LAPACK/BLAS may also be required to
perform certain functions.

Example of linking to Armadillo and Accelerate Framework:

g++ main2.cpp -framework Accelerate -larmadillo -o learning
