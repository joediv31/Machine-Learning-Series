These are the source files that go along with Part 4
of my Create A Machine Learning Library in C++ Series
located at http://joediv.com.

main4.cpp requires that the Armadillo C++ & NLopt Libraries
are installed in order to compile. The libraries can be
found at their respective websites:

http://arma.sourceforge.net/
http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt

The Mac Accelerate Framework, or LAPACK/BLAS may also be required to
perform certain functions.

First you must compile the smartclass files as shown below:

g++ -c smartclass.cc -o smartclass.o

Then compile with smartclass.o and link to Armadillo, Accelerate Framework, & NLopt:

g++ main4.cpp smartclass.o -framework Accelerate -larmadillo -lnlopt -lm -o learning
