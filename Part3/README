These are the source files that go along with Part 3
of my Create A Machine Learning Library in C++ Series
located at http://joediv.com.

main3.cpp requires that the Armadillo C++ & NLopt Libraries 
are installed in order to compile. The libraries can be 
found at their respective websites:

http://arma.sourceforge.net/
http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt

The Mac Accelerate Framework, or LAPACK/BLAS may also be required to
perform certain functions.

Example of linking to Armadillo, Accelerate Framework, & NLopt:

g++ main3.cpp -framework Accelerate -larmadillo -lnlopt -lm -o learning
